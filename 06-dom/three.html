<script>
  const div=  document.createElement('div')
  console.log(div); //will print <div></div>
  //We want to add properties to this div element like classname,id ,etc.
  //Every element is a node list in itself as it has all values but they are not set .
  div.className="main"
  div.id=Math.round(Math.random()*10+1) //Will set some random big number as the id of the div.
  div.setAttribute("title","generated title") //setAttribute has to be given a key-value pair.Here title attribute is give the value "generated title".
  div.style.backgroundColor="green"
  div.style.padding="12px"
  //Now the div we have created is in the memory.It is still not in the page.We have to attach it to the document.
  //div.innerText="Chai or code"
  const addText=document.createTextNode("Chai aur code") //Better way as You can add multiple text nodes without overwriting existing content.
  div.appendChild(addText) //Now the TextNode created will be added to the div. 
  //Now finally attach div to the document
  document.body.appendChild(div)

What's the difference between div.id=" " and div.setAttribute("id"," ")??

both div.id = "something" and div.setAttribute("id", "something") set the id of an element, but they do it slightly differently in how and when they work.

Type 	                                Property assignment	                                              Method call
Affects	                      DOM property (and also syncs HTML attribute)	       HTML attribute (and also syncs DOM property)
Use case	                When setting common properties like id, className, etc.	    When setting any attribute, especially non-standard or custom ones
Performance	                             Slightly faster	                                             Slightly slower
Example of flexible use	       ❌ Can't set data attributes like data-info	               ✅ Can set data-info or any custom attribute
