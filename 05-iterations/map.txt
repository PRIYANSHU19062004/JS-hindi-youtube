A Map is a special object in JavaScript that stores key-value pairs.
It is similar to an object, but with some important differences.

✅ Key Features of Map

1. Any type can be a key
In objects, keys are always strings (or symbols).
In Map, keys can be anything: string, number, boolean, object, function, etc.

2.Keeps insertion order
A Map remembers the order in which keys were inserted.

3.Built-in methods
set(key, value) → add/update a key-value pair
get(key) → get value by key
has(key) → check if key exists
delete(key) → remove a key
clear() → remove everything
size → number of entries
When to Use What

✅ Use Map when:

You need key-value pairs with keys of any type.

You often add/remove entries.

You care about insertion order or iteration performance.

✅ Use Object when:

You need a simple structure for static key-value data.

You plan to use it for JSON data exchange or plain data models.


const obj = { name: 'Priyanshu', age: 21 };
console.log(obj['name']); // Priyanshu

// Using Map
const map = new Map();
map.set('name', 'Priyanshu');
map.set('age', 21);
console.log(map.get('name')); // Priyanshu
