//Objects can declared in two ways -like a literal and like a constructor
//singleton-when we form an object through a constructor then the object formed is singleton or it is one of its kind
//when we declare through literals then singletons are not formed.Multiple instances of that object are formed.
//singleton objects are created like Object.create
/////////////////++++++++++/////////////
//Object literals
const mySym=Symbol("key1") //Declaring a symbol.'mySym' is the name of the symbol.
